# The 'fdensity' package

This function computes and draws the conditional densities of `x` for each value of the discrete variable `d` (aka "factor"). Hence the package name (factorized density). This can be seen as a companion feature to `boxplot x d --factorized`. It also extends the built-in command `kdplot` and makes internally use of gretl's `kdensity()` function. The optimal bandwitdh is computed by what is known as Silverman's rule of thumb (for details see here: https://gretl.sourceforge.net/gretl-help/funcref.html#kdensity).

_Warning_: the maximum number of different values for the factor is set to `MAXVAL = 12` (the plot would be unreadable otherwise IMO). Moreover, in order to compute the conditional density, at least `MINOBS = 30` valid observations must be available for each category. Categories that don't meet that requirement will be ignored.

Please ask questions and report bugs on the Gretl mailing list if possible. Alternatively, create an issue ticket on the github repo (see below).

The function signature is

``` function bundle fdensity(const series x, const series d, bundle opts_in[null]) ```

Internally, this function uses the `kdensity()` function, and its optional parameters (bandwidth and kernel choice) can be passed via appropiate keys in the option bundle.

## Parameters

- `x`:  `series`, Input series for which to compute conditional densities
- `d`:  `series`, Discrete variable (numeric or string-valued) defining the `p` distinct "factors".

More generally, the option bundle accepts the following keys:

- `control`: as in kdensity: kernel choice, 0 = Gaussian (default), 1 = Epanechnikov
- `scale`: as in gretl's built-in function `kdensity()`: bandwidth adjustment factor; By default this value is `1` and the optimal bandwidth is computed by Silverman's method.
- `bw_skip_na`: `bool`, Indicator for skipping missing values. `FALSE` to include missing values, `TRUE` to remove them (default: `TRUE`).
- `bw_verbose`: `bool`, Indicator for printing bandwidth selection results. `FALSE` to disable, `TRUE` to enable (default: `FALSE`).
- `dest`: string, destination (default = `display`)
- `title`: string, plot title (default = "")
- `ylabel`: string, label at the y-axis (default = "")
- `xlabel`: string, label at the x-axis (default = "")
- `fontsize`: scalar, Size of font for title and labels (default: `10`)
- `fontsize_tics`: scalar, Size of font tics on the y- and the x-axis (default: `10`)
- `linewidth`: scalar, Width of line(s) (default: `2.0`)
- `pointsize`: scalar, Size of points for lines (default: `0.75`; only relevant if `auto_pointtype = TRUE`)
- `auto_dashtype`: bool, Switch on dashed lines with automatic type selection (default = `FALSE`)
- `auto_pointtype`: bool, Switch on lines with points with automatic pointtype selection (default = `FALSE`)
- `monochrome`: bool, Lines are coloured black (default = `FALSE`)
- `nokey`: bool, Do not show key (legend) (default = `FALSE`)
- `single_y_axis`: bool, Enforce single y-axis (default = `FALSE`)
- `add_opts`: string, You may pass additional gnuplot commands as a string (default = "")

The returned bundle has the same keys as the option bundle, plus

- `err`: an error code which is `0` in case of no error, otherwise `1`.
- `f`: a matrix with `p+1` columns. The first `p` columns hold the estimated density or densities at each of these points and the `p+1`-th column holds a set of evenly spaced abscissae.
- `kept`: a vector holding the distinct values of the factors (from input series `f`) actually used for computing the densities. (Others may have been skipped due to insufficient number of observations.)
- `scale`: scalar value holding the optimal bandwitdh if the original value of `scale` is `1` in which case the optimal bandwidth gets computed.
